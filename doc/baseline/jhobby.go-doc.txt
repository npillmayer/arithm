package jhobby // import "github.com/npillmayer/arithm/jhobby"

Package jhobby deals with MetaFont/MetaPost-like paths. It provides an
implementation of John Hobby's spline interpolation algorithm.

Spline interpolation by Hobby's algorithm results in aesthetically pleasing
curves superior to "normal" spline interpolation (as used in many graphics
programs). The primary source of information for "Hobby-splines" is:

    Smooth, Easy to Compute Interpolating Splines -- John D. Hobby

    Report No. STAN-CS-85-1047, Jan 1985
    http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/85/1047/CS-TR-85-1047.pdf

The practical algorithm is explained in

A good discussion of the implementation may be found in:

This Go implementation is not the result of transcoding any of these
implementations, but it is of course inspired by them. The notation sticks
closely to the original code in MetaFont. The API's concept for path building
very loosely follows the ideas in PyX.

# Usage

Clients of the package usually build a "skeleton" path, without any spline
control point information. Such a path is called a "HobbyPath" and it may
contain various parameters at knots and/or joins. In the MetaFont/MetaPost DSL
one may specify it as follows:

    (0,0)..(2,3)..tension 1.4..(5,3)..(3,-1){left}..cycle

On evaluation of this path expression, MetaFont/MetaPost immediately will find
the control points in a clever way to construct a smooth curve through the
knots of the path. When using the methods of package "path", clients will build
a skeleton path with a kind of builder pattern (package qualifiers omitted for
clarity and brevity):

    Nullpath().Knot(P(0,0)).Curve().Knot(P(2,3)).TensionCurve(N(1.4),N(1.4)).Knot(P(5,3))
       .Curve().DirKnot(P(3,-1),P(-1,0)).Curve().Cycle()

Alternatively clients may put interface HobbyCurve over their own path
data structure. Either way, a HobbyPath will then be subjected to a call to
FindHobbyControls(...)

    controls = FindHobbyControls(path, nil)

which returns the necessary control point information to produce a smooth curve:

    (0,0) .. controls (-0.5882,1.2616) and (0.4229,2.6442)
     .. (2,3) .. controls (2.7160,3.1616) and (4.3325,3.2937)
     .. (5,3) .. controls (6.5505,2.3177) and (6.2401,-0.4348)
     .. (3,-1) .. controls (1.8036,-1.2085) and (0.4731,-1.0144)
     .. cycle

# Caveats

(1) The development of this package is still in a very early phase. Please do
use with caution!

(2) Currently there are slight deviations from MetaFont's calculation, probably
due to different rounding. These are under investigation.

(3) Currently it isn't possible to explicitly set control points, as I don't
need this functionality. This may or may not change in the future. Please note
that the goal of this project is ultimately to support graphical requirements
for typesetting, not implementing a graphical system. If you need a full fledged
engine for preparing illustrations, you should stick to MetaPost, which is a
really great piece of software!
